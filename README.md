Q1 Frontend Project Paper-Rocks-Scissors

I intend to create a Paper - Rock - Scissors game that allows a player to play against the computer and upload their own titles and images to represent the 3 game choices in their own personalized way.

The game will identify which player won a round and as a stretch goal will also keep score for who wins best 2 out of 3.
