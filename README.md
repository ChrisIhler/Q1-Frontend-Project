Q1 Frontend Project Paper-Rocks-Scissors

I intend to create a Paper - Rock - Scissors game that allows a player to play against the computer and upload their own titles and images to represent the 3 game choices in their own personalized way.

The game will identify which player won a round and with be a best 2 out of 3 game that also generates the official winner of ther game as well.
