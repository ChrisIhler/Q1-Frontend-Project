Q1 Frontend Project Paper-Rocks-Scissors

I intend to create a Paper - Rock - Scissors game that allows a player to play against the computer and annouces the winner of the game.

Stretch Goals:

1. The Game will allow users to upload their own titles and images to represent personalized versions of the game pieces. 
2. The Game will tell the player who won best 2 out of 3.
