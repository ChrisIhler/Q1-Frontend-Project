Idea 1

Create a brain game that tracks users on how well they can answer the question "does this card match the previous card" This game would display the users score.

To play the game go to Q1-ChrisIhler.surge.sh

To play the game simply navigate to the 'Play' page and click on the 'Start' button. Then at the button of the screen click "Yes Match!" or "No Match!" if the next photo that appears matches the previous photo. When the player wants to stop simple click on the stop button and watch your percentage of correct answers show in the top of the game. 

Also on the "Settings" page you can submit user information and some extra gameplay options. 

Have fun!
